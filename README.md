# Bootstrap Material Design Theme for Drupal

A [Bootstrap](https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap) subtheme that brings the [Material Design guidelines by Google](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) into Drupal. Uses Fez Vrasta's [Material Design for Bootstrap](https://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design) theme.

## Set up

1. Download and extract the base theme, [Bootstrap Theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap), into the themes directory of your Drupal installation. I recommend installing the latest development snapshot of Bootstrap Theme 7.x-3.x until 7.x-3.1 is released.
   
2. Download and extract this subtheme into the themes directory. (Also available as a [sandbox project](https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/othermachines/2535992) on Drupal.org.)
   
3. Enable the subtheme and customize as desired.
